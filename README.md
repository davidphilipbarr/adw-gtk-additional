# adw-gtk-additional

gtk.css to go in ~/.config/gtk-3.0/gtk.css

Icon theme to go in ~/.local/share/icons/

Adds roundness to context menus, some additional icons to better match libadwaita (menu item arrow mostly).

With additional:
![](./nautilus_with.png "Nautilus with gtk.css")

Normal:
![](./nautilus_without.png "Nautilus with only adw-gtk3")
